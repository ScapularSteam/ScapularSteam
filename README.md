Hi, I am an aspiring developer currently working on learning C# and Java, putting new skills to the test by developing my new app, Fletchpad, that solves a geniune problem: 

>*That most, if not all Archery Scoring Apps, to a degree, are outdated in UI and lack proper dark modes*. 

I wish to solve this problem, and that of friends along the way :)
